## Solution(s)


### C++

### Java

```
class Solution {
    public int minMalwareSpread(int[][] graph, int[] initial) {
        int N = graph.length;
        int[] clean = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(clean, 1);
        for (int x: initial)
            clean[x] = 0;

        // For each node u in initial, dfs to find
        // 'seen': all nodes not in initial that it can reach.
        ArrayList<Integer>[] infectedBy = new ArrayList[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            infectedBy[i] = new ArrayList();

        for (int u: initial) {
            Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet();
            dfs(graph, clean, u, seen);
            for (int v: seen)
                infectedBy[v].add(u);
        }

        // For each node u in initial, for every v not in initial
        // that is uniquely infected by u, add 1 to the contribution for u.
        int[] contribution = new int[N];
        for (int v = 0; v < N; ++v)
            if (infectedBy[v].size() == 1)
                contribution[infectedBy[v].get(0)]++;

        // Take the best answer.
        Arrays.sort(initial);
        int ans = initial[0], ansSize = -1;
        for (int u: initial) {
            int score = contribution[u];
            if (score > ansSize || score == ansSize && u < ans) {
                ans = u;
                ansSize = score;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public void dfs(int[][] graph, int[] clean, int u, Set<Integer> seen) {
        for (int v = 0; v < graph.length; ++v)
            if (graph[u][v] == 1 && clean[v] == 1 && !seen.contains(v)) {
                seen.add(v);
                dfs(graph, clean, v, seen);
            }
    }
}
```

### Python

Intuition and Algorithm

Let G be the graph with all the nodes from initial removed.

For each node v not in initial, we want to know which nodes u from initial can reach v in the graph G [with u (and its edges) added to G]. Let's say these nodes u "infect" v.

Afterwards, we want to know which nodes v are uniquely infected by only one u. For each such pair, it contributes 1 to the answer for u.

```
class Solution(object):
    def minMalwareSpread(self, graph, initial):
        N = len(graph)
        clean = set(range(N)) - set(initial)
        def dfs(u, seen):
            for v, adj in enumerate(graph[u]):
                if adj and v in clean and v not in seen:
                    seen.add(v)
                    dfs(v, seen)

        # For each node u in initial, dfs to find
        # 'seen': all nodes not in initial that it can reach.
        infected_by = {v: [] for v in clean}
        for u in initial:
            seen = set()
            dfs(u, seen)

            # For each node v that was seen, u infects v.
            for v in seen:
                infected_by[v].append(u)

        # For each node u in initial, for every v not in initial
        # that is uniquely infected by u, add 1 to the contribution for u.
        contribution = collections.Counter()
        for v, neighbors in infected_by.iteritems():
            if len(neighbors) == 1:
                contribution[neighbors[0]] += 1

        # Take the best answer.
        best = (-1, min(initial))
        for u, score in contribution.iteritems():
            if score > best[0] or score == best[0] and u < best[1]:
                best = score, u
        return best[1]
