- Problem: Range. Queries for Longest Correct Bracket Subsequence


Given a bracket sequence or in other words a string S of length n, consisting of characters ‘(‘ and ‘)’. Find length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence for a given query range. Note: A correct bracket sequence is the one that have matched bracket pairs or which contains another nested correct bracket sequence. For e.g (), (()), ()() are some correct bracket sequence.

Examples:

```
Input : S = ())(())(())(
        Start Index of Range = 0, 
        End Index of Range = 11
Output : 10
Explanation:  Longest Correct Bracket Subsequence is ()(())(())
```

```
Input : S = ())(())(())(
        Start Index of Range = 1, 
        End Index of Range = 2
Output : 0
```
