# CPP

In STL, erase and remove have totally different meanings. Erase means to move/delete items out of the container, but remove means to move the items to the end of the sequential container.

There is a very good graph in: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container, you can find `remove` in header file `<algorithm>` and `list`, `forward_list` container.

But `erase` exists in all containers.

```
[cling]$ #include <vector>
[cling]$ #include <algorithm>
[cling]$ using namespace std;
[cling]$ vector<int> vi={1,2,3,3,3,4,5,6};
[cling]$ remove(vi.begin(), vi.end(), 3);
[cling]$ vi
(std::vector<int> &) { 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6 }
```
